# Ironman Mode

You can play as an ironman, however, this will reset your entire account, to a fresh start.

To become an Ironman, use either of the following:

* `+m ironman`
* `+m ironman --permanent`

**Note:** You're allowed to have an ironman account and a non-ironman account. However, this requires you to run 2 discord accounts.

If you use the **--permanent** flag, you will **NOT** be able to de-iron, if you are running an ironman alternate account you are required to use the permanent flag.

Trip length extension via sacrifice value is halved for ironmen, giving the maximum 1 minute increase (or 3 minute with T3 Patron) for only 5b sacrificed rather than the usual 10b. For more info on this, please [see here](https://wiki.oldschool.gg/#minion-icons)

### Permanent Ironman Perks

Being a _permanent ironman_ provides the following perks:

* Shared patron perks between main and ironman discord accounts
* Ironman armour (use: `+m ironman --armor`)

### Ironman Leaderboards

Any leaderboard can be filtered to only show ironmen. This is done by adding `--im` at the end of any `+lb` command.

* E.g. `+lb kc vorkath --im`
* E.g. `+lb sacrifice --im`
* E.g. `+drystreak corp, elysian sigil --im` (T3 patrons only)
