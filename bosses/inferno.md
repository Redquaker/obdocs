# Inferno

## Summary

The Inferno is a very high level PVM activity. It has high gear requirements, consumes large amounts of expensive supplies, and attempts can take upwards of 2 hours.   &#x20;

Similar to the Fight Caves, you are not guaranteed to complete The Inferno. Your success chance scales on your gear, number of attempts, and number of Zuk fights.

At the end of The Inferno, you are rewarded with an [Infernal Cape](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Infernal\_cape). This is the best in slot melee cape in most situations. You also have a chance at getting the Inferno's pet, [Jal-nib-rek](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Jal-nib-rek) upon completion, and when gambling Infernal Capes.

Infernal capes can be gambled by doing `+capegamble infernal`

Tokkul can be spent at the [Tokkul shop](https://wiki.oldschool.gg/bosses/fight-caves/tokkul-shop).

Rune costs are reduced by having a Kodai Wand equipped in your mage setup.)                                                                                      &#x20;

### Boosts

Boosts for the Inferno are split into two categories: speed and death chance. Speed boosts          decrease the time required to complete the Inferno, and death chance boosts decrease your odds of dying before or during the Zuk fight.

Unlike most other bosses, required items and boost items must be **equipped** in the relevant setups. The Toxic Blowpipe is an exception from this rule, as it will work from your bank.

Boosts that are listed as negative (e.g. -4.5% for Adamant Darts/-4% for Ring of Suffering (i) are **good**. The - means they are either reducing the time required or your death chance. Positive numbers do the opposite, increasing your time or increasing your death chance.

#### Speed

Higher tier darts (-Adamant: -4.5%, Rune: -5.4%, Amethyst: -6.3%, Dragon: -7.2%)   &#x20;

Twisted Bow: (-7.5%) (ACB increases time by 4.5%)                 &#x20;

Unlocking Rigour and/or Augury (unlocked with `+use dexterous/arcane prayer scroll`, -4% for each)                                                                                 &#x20;

Being on task with an imbued slayer helm/black mask (requires a Tzhaar task and 1 Inferno KC, -9%)              &#x20;

Equipping an Armadyl Chestplate & Chainskirt in your range setup (-3%)      &#x20;

Equipping Ancestral Robe Top & Bottom in your mage setup (-4%)                      &#x20;

#### Death Chance

Equipping an Elysian Spirit Shield in either range or mage (-5%)     &#x20;

Equipping a Ring of Suffering (i) in either range or mage (-4%)

Equipping a Justiciar Faceguard in range (-5%)                     \
&#x20;                                                                                                                                                                  Equipping a Twisted Bow in your range setup (instead of an ACB) (1.5% from Tbow VS 7.5% with ACB)

The number of attempts you've done, and the number of times you've fought Zuk greatly affect speed and death chance.
